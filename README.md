# Eco-Optimzer

Creating an advanced tool like Eco-Optimizer involves several steps and considerations, from data collection and preprocessing to building and employing machine learning models. Here's a simplified Python program that outlines a potential approach to such a project. This example will focus on analyzing energy consumption data and providing insights on optimization, with appropriate comments and error handling.

### Key Considerations:
- **Data Collection**: The actual collection and format of data are placeholders â€” you'll need real-world energy consumption data with relevant features for meaningful results.
- **Model Selection**: The choice of a machine learning model is simplistic here. For better results, other models like Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, or neural networks might be considered based on data properties.
- **Error Handling**: This script demonstrates basic error handling techniques, which can be further enhanced with specific checks for different errors.
- **Optimization Methods**: Given the abstract nature of real-world energy usage, consideration of domain-specific knowledge for tailoring optimizations is crucial.
